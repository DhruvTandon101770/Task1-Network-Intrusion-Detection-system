Network Intrusion Detection System using Snort
Introduction:
This guide provides instructions for setting up and running a basic Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort on a Linux system. It covers installation, configuration, and basic usage.
Installation:

Install Snort by running:
sudo apt-get install snort
Set your network interface to promiscuous mode:
sudo ip link set enp0s3 promisc on (Replace 'enp0s3' with your actual network interface name)

Configuration:

Edit the Snort configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
Review and adjust settings as needed for your environment.
Test the Snort configuration:
sudo snort -T -i enp3s0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
Edit the local rules file:
sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Add the following rules to local.rules:
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Ping Detected"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"SSH Authentication Attempt"; sid:100002; rev:1;)

Running Snort:
Start Snort in IDS mode with this command:
sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort -i enp0s3 -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
Understanding the Commands:
sudo apt-get install snort: Installs Snort
sudo ip link set enp0s3 promisc on: Sets the network interface to promiscuous mode
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf: Opens the Snort configuration file for editing
sudo snort -T -i enp3s0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf: Tests the Snort configuration
sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules: Opens the local rules file for editing
sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort -i enp0s3 -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf: Runs Snort in IDS mode
